The dataset used to train the model was downloaded from the following link:

http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/

Scroll down to the 'Download' section and download the 'EnglishFnt.tgz' file of size 51.1 MB.
After extracting the above file, you will find 1016 samples of each digit and aplhabet in English Language. 
Since we require the model to recognize only the digits, I used only the digit samples and not the other samples.
The digit samples are in folders 'Sample001'-'Sample010'.

*********************

The model was not trained using the famous MNIST dataset, mainly because MNIST dataset contains handwritten images, whereas I needed my model to recognize the computer-written digits.
