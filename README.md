# Sudoku-Image-Solver
This is a software that can solve the sudoku puzzle using an image of the image. It uses Computer vision(opencv) to recognize the puzzle in the image and a machine learning model to recognize the digits in the puzzle. Then a C program solves the puzzle and returns the answer in the puzzle format.

Kindly check the 'usage.txt' file for information on how to use the software.

Information about the C program, model and datasets are present in respective folders. I encourage the users to go through them once for better understanding.

All the code is well-documented and almost everything is explained using comments.

Python 3.6 was used to compile the above python scripts and 'bcc32c' compiler was used to compile the C program.

Feel free to mention any comments. Hope you like it!!
